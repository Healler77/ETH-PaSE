    <p style="width: 300px;text-align: justify;float: right;" > <b style="color: rgba(5, 60, 122, 0.897);">HOW CAN WE PROTECT
        OURSELVES?<br>The virus can spread very easily and we carry it and pass it onto others even if we don’t feel poorly ourselves. There are 2 important things we can do to protect ourselves, our friends and our family. <br> WASH YOUR HANDS <br>
        Washing your hands with soap and water helps get rid of the virus. This will prevent the virus from getting into our bodies and spreading other people. Let’s all remind one another to wash our hands! <br> AVOID OTHER PEOPLE <br> To stop the virus spreading, we need to keep away from other people and stay at home for a time. But don’t worry - life will go back to normal!</p>



    <p style="width: 300px;text-align: justify;"> Understand basic information about coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including its symptoms, complications, how it is transmitted and how to prevent transmission. Stay informed about COVID-19 through reputable sources such as UNICEF and WHO and national health ministry advisories. Be aware of fake information/myths that may circulate by word-of-mouth or online.We are learning more about how COVID-19 affects people every day. Older people, and people with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, appear to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms. As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of COVID-19 reported among children. This is a new virus and we need to learn more about how it affects children. The virus can be fatal in rare cases, so far mainly among older people with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
